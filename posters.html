                            That was the first thing I thought when looking at the clients website. The artistic yet
                            tasteful approach to their advertisements made me excited to try and match their aesthetic
                            while still showcasing my own style.</p>

                            Rocky). First I had to do some digging. The client used
                            hand drawn images in all their advertisements, they seemed to have a knack for it. They also
                            didn't seem to mind bright colors, but they preferred pastel tones. With my newly acquired
                            information I got to work, I wanted to match their aesthetic of hand drawn but I didn't want
                            to match it too closely. The final design is meant to resemble building blocks, the colors
                            and shading is meant to resemble crayons. Once I finished the overall shape and look
                            of the words the only thing left was to pick the tones. Yikes. After another 30 minutes It
                            was done, and I have to say im quite proud. </p>

                            company's information and their requested quote. While studying the clients website and
                            LinkedIn I noticed their vibe was a modern minimalism approach,
                            and also noticed that black and white was their favorite color scheme. With
                            this in mind I chose to let the typography be the center of the ad, drawing attention to not
                            only the
                            quote but also the ad itself. I didn't want too much color but I did want the name of the
                            nominee to stand out, to do this I chose red due to it's vibrance. Lastly I needed the name
                            of their team to stand out as well, but to avoid color clashing I chose a lighter gray so
                            it would stand out but not too much.

                            with short fuses to me. So why haven't I designed one yet? With that thought in mind I
                            decided to design my very own grumpy character with an aesthetic
                            and feel that fits my style. The character is meant to resemble grunge style cartoon

                            with bright colors and halftones and gradients for the shading. My brother helped me come up with the name
                            and the flame styling on the letters. I spent more hours on this than i'd like to admit, but

                            vibes, it wasn't until doing research that I discovered Woodstock was in '69. Close enough.
                            I
                            went with bright colors and shades that made me think of summer. Bright pink, yellow and

                            for the sun, and sky at sunset/sunrise. I also made the supporting text look like things you
                            would see at the beach like a surfboard, and used shades that looked like a popsicle.
                            Ulltimately I was proud of the final product, and this happens to be my mom's favorite of my

                            at them a lot with my
                            family, so boom cuisine type picked, but I didn't want it to be a fancy hibachi. This needed
                            to be a fun kind, you know
                            the one you would go to with your friends and have a good time drinking sake and eating an

                            The client assured me she meant to spell it like that, and that it was a term used in her
                            job field. Cool beans, I said!
                            Once given conformation it was time for the fun part, creating a brand's identity.</p>

                            organized manner, to include a cross in the logo because her faith is very important to her,
                            and for the color scheme to make the logo brown or tan which was a bit of mix-up. We worked
                            with a few different designs, and a few different palettes until we landed on one that fit
                            the design and style of the client. If you're wondering how to say the word, it's pronounced
                            bron-dee. It's a cosmetology term for a mixture between brunette and blonde, I learned this
                            when asking the client if she meant to spell blonde that way. You learn something new

                            With the look of their website, and the way the workers carried themselves I could tell this
                            was
                            to be a straight forward and professionally made ad. But just because something is
                            professional
                            doesn't mean it cant stand out.</p>

                        <p class="moreText"> This ad was actually really fun to make despite the simple appearance, even
                            though the design was straightforward the challenge of making the nominee name and team name
                            stand out was still at hand. The company didn't want any color in their ad (except for the
                            color
                            already present in their logo), so it needed to be black, white, and gray far as color
                            spectrum
                            (even though technically black isn't a color). Well if i've learned anything being a
                            designer
                            for so long it's that color isn't actually always needed to make something pop. If you want
                            something to stand out make it differ from the majority. With this learned tip in mind I
                            made
                            the name of the nominee black, as well as the team name and went and made the rest of the
                            words
                            gray. I kept the design elements to a minimum and kept things structured. Mission Complete.
